From the course, I realized that the process of interpretation of user needs begins with the ability to comprehend what the user wants to achieve and not only focus on what they want. User stories were useful in measuring the needs of the user and creating a clear guideline on what the user wants to achieve by focusing on the user and the value they want to acquire. By applying the process of creating programs, I am now working on smaller and manageable chunks instead of creating the whole program at a time. Agile methods like sprint planning, daily meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives were instrumental in keeping me flexible and keeping the team aware of any issues and focusing on improving the product as well as my process. I look forward to applying the Agile process method in future developments because, through the method, the team is encouraged to be flexible and deliver value constantly. A good team member in a computer system development team is a person who is communicative and tolerant and takes responsibility for the task they are allocated while working for the goals and objectives of the team as well. A good team member is also a person who is ready to accept and share feedback and is flexible and prepared to change whenever the requirements change while helping the team to develop a positive working environment.
